# SWE Foam Coding Challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started
This is a quick summary of the project. It is a React app created with a Node/Express backend API, set up with SQLite3 and Knex for local file storage. The app is designed to fetch images from a database, where a user can review the images (a smaller set of images is shown per page as there are many!). A user can also tag the images with "foam," "non-foam" or leave them uncategorized. Currently, there is an option to toggle all of the images categorized as "foam" and display them at the top of the page, outlined with a read border to differentiate them from the rest. Users can also click forward to the next page(s) or click backward with in-app buttons (no need to use the browser back buttons).
